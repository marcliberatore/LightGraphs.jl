### Writing a Graph
Graphs may be written to I/O streams and files using the `write` function:

`write(io, g)`  
Writes a graph `g` in a proprietary format to the IO stream designated by `io`.

`write(g, fn[, compress=true])`  
Writes a graph to a file `fn`, with default `GZip` compression.

Both `write` functions will return tuples containing the number of vertices and
number of edges written.

### Reading a Graph From a File
Graphs stored using the `write` functions above may be loaded using `readgraph`:

`readgraph(fn)`  
Returns a graph loaded from file `fn`.

`readgraphml(fn)`  
Returns a graph from file `fn` stored in [GraphML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GraphML)
format.


###Examples
```julia
julia> write(STDOUT, g)
julia> write(g, "mygraph.jgz")
julia> g = readgraph("mygraph.jgz")
julia> g = readgraphml("mygraph.xml")
```
