*LightGraphs.jl* takes its inspiration from the excellent
[NetworkX](http://networkx.github.io) project. Many of the features in
*NetworkX* have been replicated in *LightGraphs*.

The project goal is to mirror the functionality of robust network and graph
analysis libraries such as [NetworkX](http://networkx.github.io) while being
simpler to use and more efficient than existing Julian graph libraries such as
[Graphs.jl](https://github.com/JuliaLang/Graphs.jl). It is an explicit design
decision that any data not required for graph manipulation (attributes and other
information, for example) is expected to be stored outside of the graph
structure itself. Such data lends itself to storage in more traditional and
better-optimized mechanisms.
